## Syntax

**Coalesce** (*Value*, [*Value*], â€¦,[*Value*])
  
The **Coalesce** function contains the following arguments
  
|**Argument name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| *Value*  <br/> |An expression. |

## Remarks

If all arguments are NULL, **Coalesce** returns NULL.
  
## Example

The following expression is used as the validation rule for a table. The expression ensures that entries are made in the First Name, Last Name, Email, Mobile Phone, Work Phone, Home Phone, and Company fields before a record is committed. If any of the listed fields are left blank, the **Coalesce** function returns Null, which violates the validation rule.
  
```vb
Coalesce([First Name],[Last Name],[Email],[Mobile Phone],[Work Phone],[Home Phone],[Company]) Is Not Null
```
