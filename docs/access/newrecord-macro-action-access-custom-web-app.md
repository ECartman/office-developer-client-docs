# NewRecord Macro Action (Access custom web app)

Creates a new, blank record in the current view.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft no longer recommends creating and using Access web apps in SharePoint. As an alternative, consider using [Microsoft PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) to build no-code business solutions for the web and mobile devices. 
  
## Remarks

You can use the **NewRecord** action to add a blank record at the end of view so you can enter new data. 
  
The **NewRecord** action is equivalent to using the **Add** button in the action bar to add a record.
