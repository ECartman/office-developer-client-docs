## Syntax

 **Now** ()
  
## Remarks

The result of the **Now** function changes only when the column that contains the formula is refreshed. It is not updated continuously.
  
The **Today** function returns the same date but is not precise with regard to time; the time returned is always 12:00:00 AM and only the date is updated.
