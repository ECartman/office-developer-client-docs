# RunMacro Macro Action (Access custom web app)

You can use the **RunMacro** action to run a user interface (UI) macro. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft no longer recommends creating and using Access web apps in SharePoint. As an alternative, consider using [Microsoft PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) to build no-code business solutions for the web and mobile devices. 
  
## Setting

The **RunMacro** action has the following arguments. 
  
|**Action argument**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Macro Name** <br/> |The name of the UI macro to run. |
   
## Remarks

When you run a UI macro containing the **RunMacro** action, and it reaches the **RunMacro** action, Access runs the called UI macro. When the called UI macro has finished, Access returns to the original UI macro and runs the next action.
